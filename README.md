# Stock Price Prediction System

## üìå Overview
This project implements a **Stock Price Prediction System** using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model**. The system fetches market data, processes it, makes predictions, and visualizes the insights for financial analysts and traders.

## üöÄ Features
- **Stock Price Prediction:** Uses historical market data to predict the future closing price.
- **Technical Indicators:** Incorporates moving averages, Bollinger Bands, and cumulative returns.
- **User Interface:** Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive experience.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Supports batch and real-time data ingestion.
- **Model Monitoring & Updates:** Ensures accuracy with periodic retraining.

## üìä System Architecture

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Ingestion
- **Sources:** Live market data from APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) & CSV files.
- **Batch & Streaming:** Supports both **real-time** and **historical** data processing.
- **Storage:** Saves processed data in a **SQLite/PostgreSQL** database for future use.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Processing Pipeline
- **Preprocessing:** Cleans missing values, normalizes data using **MinMaxScaler**.
- **Feature Engineering:** Computes **Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, and Lag Features**.
- **Storage Architecture:** Raw data and transformed features are stored for future reference.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Operations
- **Training:** The **LSTM model** is trained on historical stock data.
- **Evaluation:** Assessed using **RMSE & MAPE**.
- **Deployment:** The trained model is stored as a `.keras` file and loaded dynamically.
- **Monitoring:** Performance is tracked, and the model is retrained periodically.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Insight Delivery
- **Web App:** Uses **Streamlit** for an interactive UI.
- **Visualizations:** Displays stock trends, predicted prices, and technical indicators.
- **Alerts:** Future enhancement includes email/SMS notifications for price changes.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ System Considerations
- **Scalability:** Can be deployed on **AWS/GCP** for real-time trading.
- **Reliability:** Uses **error handling** and **logging** for robustness.
- **Latency:** Optimized preprocessing & inference for fast results.
- **Cost:** Balances cloud-based vs. local deployment based on user requirements.

## üõë Challenges & Solutions
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing Data
- **Solution:** Impute missing values using **interpolation & forward-fill techniques**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Drift Over Time
- **Solution:** Periodic **retraining** with new data & evaluation.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Data Processing
- **Solution:** Implement **Kafka** or **WebSockets** for live updates.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Security & Privacy
- **Solution:** Use **secure API keys & encrypted storage**.
